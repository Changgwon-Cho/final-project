# 💻 Changgwon Cho - Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It showcases my background, skills, projects, and contact information in a modern, responsive layout.

> Based on [Animesh Rawat’s dark-light themed portfolio template](https://github.com/rawatanimesh/portfolio-website-dark-light-themes), modified and customized to reflect my own profile and career journey.

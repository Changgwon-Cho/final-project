# My Travel Diary

## About the Project

**My Travel Diary** is a website created to record the memories of my travels abroad with my girlfriend after the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many ways to preserve memories, but documenting them one by one on a website I built myself‚Äîand gradually adding new features along the way‚Äîwill make the experience even more meaningful.
